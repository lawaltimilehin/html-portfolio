<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate UI/UX designer focused on creating intuitive, user-centered digital experiences. I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, beautiful, and functional designs that people love to use. My goal is always to balance aesthetics with usability, ensuring every interface feels natural, engaging, and purposeful.</p>

<p>I specialize in research-driven design, wireframing, prototyping, and crafting seamless user journeys. By understanding user needs and business goals, I design solutions that not only look good but also solve real problems. I believe great design is not just about visuals—it's about how it works, how it feels, and how it improves everyday interactions.</p>

<p>When I'm not designing, I'm constantly learning, exploring new trends, and refining my skills to stay ahead in the evolving tech space. That is why you are seeing this. I am currently trying out the web development path of tech. I'm excited about building meaningful products, collaborating with creative teams, and making digital experiences more accessible, enjoyable, and impactful.</p>
